    "about": "❗Your engineers are wasting 6+ months building meeting integrations.❗\n\nWhy? Because every platform (Zoom, Google Meet, MS Teams) has different APIs, constant updates, and hidden edge cases.\n\n❌ Building in-house = wasted engineering time.\n❌ Maintaining it = ongoing distractions from core product development.\n❌ Scaling it = reliability nightmares that break at the worst time.\n\nThat’s why we built Recall.ai.\n\n✅ One API to handle every meeting integration for you.\n✅ Ship in days, not months.\n✅ Powering 1200+ companies, from early-stage startups to billion-dollar SaaS teams.\n\n🚀 See how Recall.ai can save your engineers months of work",
