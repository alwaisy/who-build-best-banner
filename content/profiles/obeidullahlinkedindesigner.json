    "about": "I build LinkedIn-centric brand systems that turn attention into booked calls.\n\nYour profile isn’t a bio. It’s a due-diligence filter. I standardize the signals buyers scan first: clarity, authority, relevance, proof.\n\nWhat I do\n- Banner system with message ladder and authority variants\n- Headline, About, and Featured that pass the 5-second test\n- Content design system for insights, cases, teardowns, and offers\n- Color, type, and spacing tokens so every asset is unmistakably you\n\nWhy it works\nPeople skim. Algorithms skim. Consistency lowers cognitive load, speeds understanding, and reduces perceived risk. Inconsistent cues reset recognition to zero. I fix that.\n\nOutcomes\nFaster recognition in feed and profile views\nHigher reply and booked-call rates\nShorter sales cycles and stronger price power\n\nWho I help\nCreators and founders who sell through content: advisors, operators, recruiters, B2B consultants.\n\nHow we ship\n48-hour Sprint for a converting profile fast.\nSystem builds when you want a repeatable content engine.\n\nDesign is not decoration. Design is signal. Signals cut uncertainty. Uncertainty kills deals.\n\nIf you want LinkedIn to feel like a pipeline, not a poster, let’s align your signals and go to market.",
