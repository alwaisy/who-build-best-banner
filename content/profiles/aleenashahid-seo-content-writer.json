    "about": "I went from broke university student to 6-figure solopreneur.\n\n(All through LinkedIn… wild, I know lol)\n\nIn 2021, I started as a baby writer\ntaking random blog gigs just to survive.\n\nAnd if you’ve been in the business…\nyou know the usual (hustle) drill:\n\n1. Saying yes to every low-budget client\n2. Working until your brain (and soul) melted\n3. Getting ghosted when invoices were due..ughhhh\n\nThen repeating it while pretending\nyou were “grateful for the opportunity.”\n\nIt drained me in ways I didn’t even understand then.\n\nI was thinking about work 24/7\nand became a walking ball of panic. \n\n\"What if I never find a (real) job?\"\n\nSo I changed how I operated:\n\n+ Stopped chasing random work\n+ Built a content system around my strengths\n+ Started posting to attract and not to convince\n\nIn 90 days, everything flipped.\n\n→ Founders started DMing me\n→ My content became my portfolio\n→ I finally felt like I had a skill I could build a life on\n\nAnd that’s when it finally clicked.\n\nFounders & CXOs have everything they need to win:\n\n→ Strong product & demand\n→ Clear track record\n→ Real results\n\nBut their ideal buyers?\n\nThey have no idea they exist.\n\nLinkedIn isn’t broken for them.\nTheir content system is.\n\nThat’s why I built my Done-For-You Content Service:\n\n+ I write one clear and crisp message, everywhere. \n+ I turn your content into trust-building machine. \n+ I structure your content for conversions. \n\nMy results? \n\n🍕 100+ clients supported \n🍕 5,500+ content pieces created\n🍕 7-fig+ in new client revenue driven\n🍕 4.5M+ organic reach for a single client\n🍕 15+ niches served through DFY content\n\nIf you're tired of playing the content guessing game while \nmoney leaks through the cracks, book a 1:1 for free.\n\nBe in touch soon, yeah? \n\nPs: I also take payments in pizzas \nbut they have to be very cheesyyy 🍕",
