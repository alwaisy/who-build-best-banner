    "about": "“Yay! the posting has been very effective all around! Our company page on linkedin has increase by 1000%, new followers by 1400%, new page views by 1000%.\n\nAbout 5 quality leads every week.”\n\nThat’s the message my Forbes 30U30 founder client sent to their team on Slack after one month of letting me build their personal brand on LinkedIn.\n\nSo, you might be the CEO/founder of a cool business.\n\nBut do you know what makes you cooler?\n\nHaving that unshakable LinkedIn presence.\n\nBut why does it matter so much?\n\nI'll tell you exactly why.\n\nThink this through for a second. What if you could:\n\n- Beat your competitor's presence on LinkedIn.\n\n- The same audience that you can also monetize anytime.\n\n- Have a loyal audience for your crazy-good life experiences.\n\n- Be invited to events and talks without you having to reach out to them.\n\nALL of this at an expense of less than 2 hours/month.\n\n(Honestly, if I were you, I'd say this is a pretty solid deal.)\n\n\"Sachin, all of this sounds really charming. But why you and not the last LinkedIn branding guy I just talked to?\"\n\nIn 2023, I've generated over 90,00,000 impressions and 37,000 followers for my clients on LinkedIn.\n\n I have several testimonials, however one that stands out is from Marc Randolph (Netflix’s co-founder) when he told one of my clients he liked their LinkedIn content (That I prepared). \n\nI watched a lot of Netflix yet couldn’t chill out that night.\n\nAnd the best part about working with me?\n\nOnce I onboard you, you'll never have to worry about your LinkedIn again.\n\n93% of our clients stay for longer than a year. \n\nThey are not only happy, they even asked me to handle their other social media handles.\n\n- You don't have to get on a bazillion meetings with me.\n- Fill a ton of Google forms.\n- Be available 24/7 for me.\n\nAll I ask for is 4 one-hour Zoom calls with me in a month if you want the kind of results I spoke about earlier.\n\nAnd here, I'm done self-promoting, lol. \n\nBut hey, now you have 2 choices at hand:\n\nA. \n\n- You can think I'm bluffing.\n- Start writing on LinkedIn yourself.\n- Or worse, have an intern do it for you.\n- Realize that it wasn't easy as you thought.\n- Eventually give up and lose everything LinkedIn can offer you.\nOr \n\nB. You can just leave it all to me. \n\n- I give your brand more awareness.\n- I bring an audience that wants to listen to you.\n- I bring qualified business inquiries that give you more sales.\n\nTake your time to decide. \n\nA or B.\n\nIf you decide B, text me \"Grow my LinkedIn.\"\n\nWe'll be speaking soon.",
