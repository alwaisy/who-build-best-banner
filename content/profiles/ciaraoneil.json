    "about": "Hi, I’m Ciara - founder of Brandfulness and creator of the Aligned Brand Method™.\n\nI don’t just help you grow on LinkedIn - I help you build a personal brand that grows your reputation, authority, and influence as a founder, agency leader or consultant.\n\nIt’s not about posting more. It’s about becoming known for what you do best, and trusted for how you do it.\n\nThrough my psychology-backed Aligned Brand Method™, we take an identity-first approach: clarifying your message, refining your positioning, and shaping how you're perceived - so your personal brand doesn’t just show up… it stands out.\n\nThis work goes beyond content. It’s about building a personal brand that drives recognition, demand, and leadership-level opportunities. From inbound clients and strategic partnerships to keynote invitations and media features.\n\nBecause visibility alone won’t grow your brand.\nClarity, credibility, and consistent positioning will.\n\n🔥 The result?\n✓ A personal brand that’s strategic, scalable, and built around who you truly are\n✓ Visibility that builds trust and positions you as a leader in your space\n✓ Authority that helps grow your agency, attract aligned clients, and open bigger doors\n\n⚡️ Clients I’ve worked with have:\n• Landed brand deals and industry recognition\n• Grown consistent inbound opportunities from high-value clients\n• Been invited to speak at conferences and won awards for their thought leadership\n• Increased revenue, visibility, and credibility without burning out\n\n🎤 What Clients Say:\n\"Working with Ciara unscrambled all the ideas I had for my business, and helped me find a way to confidently communicate what I do and why I'm different everywhere I show up -  from LinkedIn to conversations with prospective clients.\" – Emily\n\nIf you're ready to build a personal brand that reflects your value, and grows your authority as a founder or agency leader:\n\n📩 Send me a DM and let’s chat.",
