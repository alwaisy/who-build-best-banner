    "about": "Hi, I’m Ciara - founder of Brandfulness and creator of the Legacy Brand Method™.\n\nI don’t just help you grow on LinkedIn. I help founders, and experts turn their expertise into thought leadership that grows their reputation, visibility, and influence.\n\nIt’s not about posting more. It’s about being known for your ideas, shaping influence in your industry, and having your name come up in the right conversations (even when you’re not in the room).\n\nBy combining your expertise with psychology-driven personal brand strategy, I help you create thought leadership that sticks, build a reputation people remember, and actively shape perception in the rooms that matter.\n\nThis work goes beyond content. It’s about building a legacy personal brand that drives recognition, demand, and opportunities → from premium client enquiries and strategic partnerships, to speaking invitations, podcast features, brand deals, industry recognition, and thought leadership status.\n\nBecause visibility alone won’t make you a leader.\n\nThought leadership will.\n\n🔥 The Result?\n✓ A personal brand that’s strategic, scalable & built around who you truly are\n✓ Visibility that builds trust & positions you as a thought leader in your space\n✓ Opportunities that grow your business, attract premium clients & opportunities\n\n⚡ Clients I’ve worked with have:\n• Been headhunted by Big 4 consultancies for their thought leadership\n• Landed paid brand deals & consistent inbound enquiries from high-value clients\n• Been invited to speak at conferences & won awards for their thought leadership\n• Increased revenue, visibility & credibility (without burning out)\n\n🎤 What Clients Say:\n\"Working with Ciara unscrambled all the ideas I had for my business, and helped me find a way to confidently communicate what I do and why I'm different everywhere I show up, from LinkedIn to conversations with prospective clients.\" – Emily\n\nIf you’re ready to build a personal brand that reflects your value, grows your thought leadership, and attracts premium opportunities:\n\n💌 Send me a DM and let’s chat.",
