    "about": "I didn’t plan on running an agency.\nBut one project led to another, one happy client turned into ten, and before I knew it, I was building full-blown products with teams across continents.\n\nHi, I’m Muhammad Abdullah, founder of wanile.ai, a design-first software agency that helps startups and enterprises build and establish products, people actually use.\n\nI’ve been lucky to work with some incredible companies, like Disney, Porsche, ICBC Bank, and fast-growing platforms like GoLegal.ai and Kitaba.\n(Kitaba, by the way, hit 100 annual plan sales on launch day, thanks to the strategy we built together, one of those proud “we really did that” moments.)\n\nThese days, we’re building 🐼 Panda Voice, a product we believe will completely disrupt the traditional survey market. We’re rethinking the way businesses collect feedback, with AI at the center, and we’re just getting started.\n\nAt Wanile, we’re not just code-pushers. We obsess over UX, we love smart design, and we care deeply about what happens after the launch, growth, retention, and everything in between.\n\nWhether you’re a funded startup or a global brand, we come in as partners, not just service providers. Because in the end, we only win if your product wins.",
