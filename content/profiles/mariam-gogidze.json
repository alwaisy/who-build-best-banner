    "about": "Financial services executives generating $500K-$10M+ are turning LinkedIn into their #1 source of institutional deal flow. Without cold outreach, without violating compliance, and without becoming \"influencers.\"\n\nYou've built a respectable firm, but:\n\n→ 80%+ of your revenue comes from referrals and warm intros\n→ Your \"little black book\" is finite, people retire, relationships fade, deals dry up\n→ You're losing opportunities to less qualified competitors with better positioning\n→ You watch fintech founders build scalable brands while you're stuck networking\n\nYou're one bad quarter away from scrambling for new business.\n\n—\n\nI get it.\nI started with zero connections.\nNo warm introductions. No country club memberships. No generational money.\nJust a girl from Georgia who didn't \"know anyone.\"\nAnd I was told that mattered.\n\nSo I built something different.\n\nI grew to 70K followers. Generated 30M+ impressions. Got featured in Entrepreneur.\nNot because I wanted followers.\nBecause I refused to beg for introductions.\n\n—\n\nNow my clients do the same:\n\nDavid raised £20M from family offices who found him on LinkedIn.\nFranco generated £6.5M without a single referral.\nLaurent closed €100M in transactions from inbound conversations.\nMarc landed a $43B company client in ONE conversation.\n\nNone of them got lucky. They built systems.\n\n—\n\nHere's the truth:\n\nYou're not invisible because you're bad at marketing.\nYou're invisible because nobody taught you how to build authority in a regulated industry.\n\nThat's what I do.\n\n—\n\nI've coached 120+ founders globally.\nRanked Top 1% in Sales & Marketing UK.\nContracted with the UK-GCC Private Capital Alliance connecting institutional capital.\n\nBut none of that matters if it doesn't work for you.\n\n—\n\nReady to escape the Rolodex trap?\n\nDM me \"ROLODEX\"\n\n—\n\nYour network got you here.\nYour authority will get you there.\n\n– Mariam\n\n** I currently take on only two new 1:1 strategy clients per month due to the depth of work and my current capacity. Please reach out regardless, you can always be waitlisted for the next available spot. I’m taking calls. **\n\n\n💌 For brand partnerships, reach me at mariam@linkedinacademy.com",
