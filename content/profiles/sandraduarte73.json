    "about": "Most leaders don’t fail because of strategy. They fail because of culture.\n\nI’ve spent 30+ years proving that when teams align, businesses thrive. \n\nI started at 17 answering phones. Since then, I’ve run and scaled multimillion-dollar companies, growing The Total Tourism Group and helping transform Centrum Group into a frontrunner in Australian print and packaging manufacturing.\n\nWhat people know me for isn’t just growth, it’s culture. I’m often called the 'Team Whisperer' because I help good people become great teams.\n\nToday I’m Co-Founder & CEO of Positive Leaders Training Company with Paris Cutler. Together we embed the Leader7™ Framework so CEOs become visionary leaders, strategy meets culture, and teams don’t just hit targets, they thrive.\n\n🟥 What we do:\n\nWe help CEOs, owners, and managers move from firefighting to focused execution.\nWe clear the noise, set the right rhythms, and build high-performing teams with tools you can use on Monday, not just admire on Friday.\n\n🟥 Who we work with:\n\n✔️ Leaders across manufacturing, food production, and tech\n✔️ CEOs & Managing Directors under pressure to transform\n✔️ Middle Managers & Supervisors navigating constant change\n✔️ Leadership Teams stuck in silos or resistance\n✔️ Owners ready to scale without burning out their people\n\n🟥 Why it works:\n\nWe don’t tick a training box. We change behaviour. Paris and I have been CEOs, founders, and consultants. We’ve earned our scars and our wins. Our approach blends real-world strategy with people-first leadership, so CEOs lead with confidence, teams align with vision, and culture becomes a competitive advantage.\n\n🟥 What makes us different:\n\n👉  No 200-slide decks. No buzzword bingo.\n👉 You get us (not juniors), honest conversations, practical playbooks, and accountability.\n👉 We measure what matters: engagement, output, retention, profit.\n👉 We only partner with a limited number of clients each year so we can stay hands-on.\n\n✅ Our Results: \nLeaders who inspire, teams who own outcomes, and a business that grows with clarity and confidence.\n\nREADY TO TALK❓\n\nThis is your moment to stop firefighting and start leading with culture. \n\n📨 Message me here or at sandra@positiveleaderstraining.com.\n\nWhen leaders rise, everyone rises.\n\nSandra\n🖥️ www.positiveleaderstraining.com",
