    "about": "In 2023, I got laid off with no warning. So I decided to turn my side hustle into my full-time business: \n\n→ 2,000+ posts written\n→ 100+ customers & clients\n→ Became a top 1% creator\n→ 1,000,000s of impressions\n→ Became a Top Voice on LinkedIn™\n→ Featured on 20+ podcasts and speaking appearances\n\nThe main thing I learned along the way: \n\nYou don’t need more content.\nYou don’t need 100k followers.\nYou don’t need to chase trends.\nYou don’t need to pray to go viral.\nYou don’t need 1,000,000s of impressions.\n\nYou need a simple system that helps you:\n\n→ Attract the right high-ticket clients from your content\n→ Sell in a way that feels natural (not pushy or “salesy”)\n→ Build a brand around your ideas and your story\n→ Get leads without cold DMs or trend-chasing\n→ Write content that works (and is fun)\n\nClarity is your best friend. And that's what I'll help you achieve.\n\nSome examples of the system in action: \n\n→ AP: Overhauled his content strategy, built an email list of 100+, and started getting inbound leads just from the welcome sequence.\n→ JM: Built his offer ladder, signed 3 multi-4-figure clients in 2 months, and hit capacity (whilst juggling a newborn baby).\n→ MA: Wrote her thoughts into posts. One got 9,202 likes. Another got 4,212. All around their own thoughts and ideas (no chasing trends). \n\n2 ways I can help you right now: \n\n1/ Grab my free playbook in the featured section: It walks through the strategy behind my brand + business (I think you'll enjoy the section “A Different Type of Success Story”)\n\n2/ DM me “coaching”: I’ll walk you through my 3-step programme and see if it’s a good fit. I keep 1 or 2 spots open for those ready to move.\n\nI hope this gave you a clearer picture of what’s possible.\n\n~ Luke",
