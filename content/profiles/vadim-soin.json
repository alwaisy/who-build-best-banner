    "about": "I started out as a mechanical engineer - the “safe” career path.\n\nAfter working at six different companies, I realized I wanted something more: freedom, creativity, and ownership.\n\nThat curiosity led me into e-commerce.\n\nI launched BEASTLY CLAWS, a premium weightlifting gear brand, and scaled it to nearly a quarter-million in sales. It taught me what most agencies never truly experience - what it feels like to run an Amazon brand from the inside.\n\nNot long after, a friend reached out and asked me to manage their Amazon ads.\n\nThe results? \n\nTheir two best revenue months ever. They told me hiring me was the best decision they’d made for their business - and that stuck with me. I knew I wanted to help more founders experience the same.\n\nThat’s how PPC Jumpstart began - a boutique Amazon Ads partner for brands that want results without the chaos.\n\nNo interns. No layers. Just hands-on strategy and accountability.\n\nI’ve personally managed over $10M+ in ad sales this year, helping brands doing $1M+ in annual revenue break through plateaus and scale profitably.\n\nMy Precision Targeted Framework™ focuses on three things:\n\n1) Targeting what matters (not bloating accounts with noise);\n2) Precision bidding to maximize profitable visibility;\n3) Scaling sustainably, with zero waste\n\nI only work with a few brands at a time, so I can stay deep in the data - and actually care about the outcomes.\n\nIf your brand spends $30K+/month on ads and you want to uncover where profit leaks and growth opportunities really are, I can walk you through my 10-Step Campaign Audit - the same process I use to qualify new clients.",
