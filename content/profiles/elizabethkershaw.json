    "about": "💜 If you’re reading this, I already know we have something in common:\n\nWe're both insanely ambitious! 🥹 But...  \n\nYou’re grinding alone in your room, trying to force more productivity, wondering why building your dream business feels less exciting than you expected.\n\nWhile I’m building my business alongside my closest friends. Constantly on calls that fire me up, celebrating wins, and feeding off the energy of like-minded girls.\n\n👉🏼 The difference between us? \n\nI’m in Journee Girls Club… and you should be too. We’d make great friends 🫶🏻\n\n💜 JGC is a private members’ club for ambitious young female founders & entrepreneurs.\n\nWe come together weekly on live calls and in our Discord to work on our businesses, swap ideas, and feel that giddy energy you only get from being around girls who are on your level.\n\n---\n\nBut we’re not just about vibes. We turn that energy into real business progress through:\n\n✨ 1:1 office hours for accountability & support\n✨ Weekly coworking (2-hour pomodoro sessions)\n✨ Hot seats, masterminds & biz-focused events\n✨ Monthly goal-setting & Linkedin content workshops\n✨ Expert masterclasses (money mindset, funnels, branding, public speaking + more)\n\n🎥 Plus 20+ replays ready to dive into from day one.\n\n✅ The girls that get it:\n• Smart, ambitious & building something real\n• Obsessed with growth + chasing big visions\n• Want deep friendships (not surface-level networking)\n\n🚫 The girls that don’t:\n• Aren’t building a biz/passion project\n• Take more than they give\n• Only there to self-promo\n\nOur members know they’re destined for more… and needed to finally be around girls that show them what their highest potential looks like - and then help them achieve it.\n\nGirls like:\n\n🙋🏼‍♀️ Mia: “I had never been part of something like this where everyone genuinely supports each other...it feels like having 20 cheerleaders keeping me going which I love!! You've created something very special.”\n\n🙋🏻‍♀️ Georgia: “Genuinely the best community l've ever joined, you've given me the best advice and always go above and beyond!! Wayyy more support than l've got from other communities 💜💜”\n\n🙋🏼‍♀️ Emily: “I mean, the outcomes speak for themselves. The value I’ve gotten from this group has been incredible. It's very much like an online family, a friendship circle. What a privilege to be a part of that.”\n\n---\n\n💌 Check out our website and join the waitlist to be the first to know when applications open again!! 💜\n\nMembership is £75/month and our value increases with each intake!\n\n(For girls between UK & SE Asia time zones only!)",
