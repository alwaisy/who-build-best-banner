    "about": "Hey, I’m Adam 👋\n\nRight now, I’m actively looking for a full-time role in social media or content. \n\nBut my story started way before that…\n\nA few years ago, I was struggling with confidence, unsure of what to do, and studying at university.\n\nSo I started teaching myself about social media, marketing, design and content creation.\n\nFast forward to now, I’ve:\n\n- Helped 15+ businesses grow on LinkedIn and Instagram through strategic content and managing their accounts.\n\n- Taught thousands of others how to improve their content and social media presence.\n\n- Built a 12K+ following on LinkedIn.\n- Written and designed 1000+ social media posts.\n- Went from 0 → 1 million impressions in 135 days.\n- Became a  top 1% creator in the UK and worldwide.\n\n- Advocated for mental health through content that connects, not just converts.\n\n- Had brands reach out to partner with me all because of content I’ve shared.\n\nBut most importantly?\n\nI’ve learned how to create content that gets results.\n\nAnd that’s what I’m looking to bring to one business.\n\nSo if you’re hiring, or want someone who truly understands social media and content, then let’s talk.\n\nHere’s how you can contact me:\n\nMessage me here on LinkedIn\nEmail me: adampeng55@googlemail.com\n\nWant to see my work?\n\nGo to my featured section to check out my portfolio.",
