    "about": "Since 2015, I helped the founders build and scale 53+ startups with a combined valuation of $138m.\n \nMy goal for 2024 is to help 20 entrepreneurs build their SaaS products and scale them using our proven outreach systems.\n\nHere’s my story:\n\nIn 2013, I made my first business move by purchasing a Facebook page dedicated to Japanese swords. To be honest, I was broke at the time and bought it for $560. \n\nThe real question is, where did I get the money? \n\nMy father had sent it for my university fees while I was studying software engineering. Despite being afraid, I took the risk and invested in buying the page.\n\nThat turned out to be one of my best decisions. I sold over 250 swords through that page, generating over $17k, until Facebook changed its rules and the page got suspended.\n\nAfter that, I started various small businesses like a bedding e-commerce store and selling mobile covers on Amazon. Some made me a few bucks, and some failed.\n\nThe end of 2014 was a turning point. My friend Umair, who was freelancing as a software engineer, referred a client to me on a partnership basis. \n\nThat’s when I decided to build Softaims to help founders build and scale their SaaS startups.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2024, here are the results:\n\n➣ Built 53+ SaaS Products\n➣ Valuation $138M+\n➣ Helped all our clients grow through marketing and sales.\n➣ Built my own startup, Softaims\n➣ Accessed 200+ top engineering teams\n\n〽️ \"M. Umar and his team did an exceptional job building my platform, Hello Median.
