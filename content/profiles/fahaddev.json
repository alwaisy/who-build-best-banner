    "about": "Your SaaS has 5 seconds to make sense. \nIf it doesn’t, every click, every ad works, gone before the scroll. \n\nEarly-stage SaaS teams often struggle with the same traps: \n\n⚪ Pages that confuse more than they clarify. \n⚪ Messaging is buried under generic templates. \n⚪ Spending too much on ads that never convert. \n\nEvery one of these costs signups, revenue, and runway. \nYour SaaS doesn’t need a prettier landing page. \nIt needs one that: \n\n⚪ Makes sense in 5 seconds. \n⚪ Turns traffic into conversions. \n⚪ Communicates value before the scroll. \n\nThat's where I come in. I'm Fahad. \nI build high-converting landing pages for Early Stage SaaS teams who can’t afford leaks in their funnel.\n\nA landing page isn’t just a webpage, it’s a growth engine. \nLeave it broken, and you'll have sales leakage. \n\nEvery visitor should become a real chance for growth. \nIf your page isn’t pulling its weight, let’s fix it. \n\nBook a 30-minute call here: \n\nhttps://calendly.com/fahadbinqaiser3/fahad-meeting-s?preview_source=et_card&month=2025-08",
