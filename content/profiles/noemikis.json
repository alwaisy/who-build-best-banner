    "about": "Hey there! 👋\n\nI'm obsessed with helping non-techie founders like you build lean, profitable businesses (think team of 5 or less) using AI, smart automations, and social media that actually converts.\n\nI built my seven-figure business with a small team and grew to 145K followers on LinkedIn plus 5K newsletter subscribers. Not by accident, but by figuring out what actually works.\n\nTomorrow's successful founders won't be grinding 80-hour weeks. They'll be the ones who learn to build with AI, automate the boring stuff, and find their people in the right corners of the internet.\n\nThat's what I share in my weekly newsletter \"Entrepreneurial Mindset\" - mindset, AI stuff, automation hacks, and the strategies that are working right now (not the stuff everyone else is talking about).\n\nJoin here: www.noemikis.com/newsletter\n\nBrands & sponsorship inquiries: hello@noemikis.com",
